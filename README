Overview
=========

This is a small project inteded to serve as framework for testing and implementing
different reinforcement learning algorithms for lexicon discovery in autonomous
robots.

This was developed while studing MUIA Master at UPM - Madrid.

And provides a plugable system for developing several shared modules for:

	1.- Different types of Agents (Two provided Deterministic and Probabilistics)
	2.- Different fitness functions to be plugged based on algorithm or agent.
	3.- Different decisors (Algorithms to make agents learn).
	4.- Different schedulers. One is provided that will make talk any agent with
	the others in a sequential way.

I also provide a small script to diagram solutions using gnuplot. 

> gnuplot
# load "plotgraph.p"

Will graph the last result executed.

The drawgraph.p is a convenience script to export results to eps.

OJAlgo functions are provided to extend the framework in the future.


Download the project
=========================

You can download the project from [git@github.com:gadLinux/Level2-Autonomous-Robots-Lexicon.git].

Install the project
===================

- Precise instructions will be provided after everything is in place.



Get ready for Eclipse
=====================

- Execute "mvn eclipse:eclipse" from the project root folder. By this way, you project can be imported into Eclipse. 
- Start Eclipse and import the project (menu File/import, select general/existing project in the workspace, than select the project root directory).

Now you are ready to modify the project from Eclipse.
